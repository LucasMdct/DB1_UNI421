Each subfolder of the "DB1_UNI421" folder corresponds to a specific course in a technology within the platform's career tracks, and each course folder corresponds to a specific project or challenge that I am working on as part of the UNI421 courses. Each project folder can contain files and directories relevant to the project in question. Additionally, each project or challenge has its own README.md file that provides detailed information about the project or challenge, such as objectives, technologies used, and important steps.
